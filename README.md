## Description

They will be presented with a page with the top 10 results with an image, title, descriptions, authors, and link displayed. A user can log in and save books that they are interested in. They can also delete books from their saved books list as well. This project makes use of node.js, express.js, react, vite, graphql, mongoDB, mongoose, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken and bootstrap.
